            <h2>Introduction:</h2>
            <p>In today’s digital landscape, ensuring robust information security is crucial for businesses of all sizes. With increasing regulatory requirements and the growing threat of cyberattacks, maintaining compliance has become both a critical necessity and a complex challenge.

        <div class="section">
            <div class="section-number">1. The Need for Streamlined Compliance Management:</div>
            <p>Businesses today face a myriad of security challenges, from managing user access to protecting sensitive data. Staying compliant with security regulations requires ongoing vigilance, frequent updates, and thorough documentation. However, managing this manually can be both time-consuming and error-prone, especially for growing businesses with limited resources.

            <p>Vanta provides companies with a customizable framework, ensuring that compliance efforts are tailored to their specific security needs. This flexibility allows organizations to focus on areas that matter most, avoiding a one-size-fits-all approach that may overlook key risks or vulnerabilities.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
            <div class="section-number">2. Driving Business Transformation with Automated Integrations:</div>
